-- Objects in SQL
-- Primary Key in a Table: unique identifier for a particular record in a table
	-- Cannot be duplicated (ie must be unique) & must be non-null
-- Primary keys are not compulsory but it is good practice to have a Primary Key for each table

CREATE TABLE stores (
  store_id number NOT NULL, -- primary key
  city VARCHAR(50) -- text, 50 characters max
);
